# metal-archives-android
An unofficial Android app for Metal Archives. Feel free to contribute!

# Current features
This app is very much work in progress. So far I've implemented the following features:

* Search for bands
* View band info, logo, etc
* View band discography and filter using the different categories (main, live, demos and misc)
* View current band lineup
* View album: track list, artwork, etc

# Backend
Right now the app uses the API provided by this project: https://github.com/Sundin/metallum-api

For the moment you have to run the backend locally in order for the app to work.
